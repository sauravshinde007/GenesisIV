OMNIDASH is a high-speed parkour shooter where movement is your greatest weapon. Equipped with only a multi-purpose gun, you must grapple, recoil-boost, wall-run, and shoot your way through a highly secured facility before they eliminate you. Every shot isn’t just an attack—it’s a tool. Use gun recoil to propel yourself, a grappling shot to swing through obstacles, and master fluid momentum-based movement to escape before time runs out.

With fast-paced parkour, skill-based gunplay, and high-intensity chases, every second counts. Will you break free or be erased?
